# ☕ Coffee Manager

**CS 121 – Term Project**

Coffee Manager is a command-line Python application that allows users to create, manage, and prepare coffee recipes. Recipes are stored in a CSV file so they persist between program runs.

The project uses object-oriented programming principles and provides a simple, menu-driven user interface.
